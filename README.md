# It Goes Cha Ching

This is a C# taskbar application that notifies you when you sell something on eBay, get a message or receive feedback.

While the eBay application provides similar functionality in their iPad app they don't have a desktop version.

I wrote it several years ago as freeware. I had a reasonable user base then ran out of time to update it.
